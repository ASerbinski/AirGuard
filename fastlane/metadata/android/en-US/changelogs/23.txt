AirGuard is now able to identify different FindMy devices reliably. It can identify AirTags,  AirPods, 3rd-party devices (e.g. Chipolo tags) and offline Apple devices (e.g. MacBooks). 
Furthermore the notification algorithm has been update to handle different devices. Apple devices will notify later (about 2.5 hours after first detection) to reduce false alarms.
