With AirGuard you get the anti-tracking protection you deserve! 
The app periodically scans your surroundings for potential tracking devices, like AirTags or other Find My devices. 

The AirTags and other Find My devices are simple, small and perfect to track Android users! 
Without tracking warnings, as integrated on iOS, anyone could try to track your behavior by placing an AirTag in your jacket, backpack or car. 

With the app you can play a sound on AirTags and find it easily. Afterward, you can view at which locations the device has tracked you. For this we use background location access. All location data never leaves your device

If you no one is trying to track you, the app will never bother you.
